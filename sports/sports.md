# Sports

Sports pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game that aims to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators. (according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport))

I really like to play and watch sports - basketball 🏀 in particular.

I try to push myself to go to the gym 🏋️ consistently.
