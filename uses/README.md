# Uses

I can be a bit of a pedant when it comes to the things I use. People who know me, know that I am usually quite frugal, however when it comes to my daily drivers, I don't mind spending the extra coin.

My purchasing principle is usually as follows: If I think and feel that an item can add value to my life and that (often most importantly) that value outweighs the price tag then in my eyes it is worth the money. The value I typically look for is convenience; does this item make my life easier?

I frequently change aspects of my setup / what constitutes as my daily drivers so I will try my best to keep this page updated.

## Hardware

### Custom Built PC (2020)

[PCPartPicker AU](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/user/ioalex/saved/df3Xyc#)

This is my pride and joy - my first build, born during the midst of Victoria's COVID-19 lockdown. I had a tonne of fun building and learning how to build this machine. 

I dual-boot Arch Linux and Windows 10. I use Arch daily for development and all other computer stuff. I primarily use Windows for gaming, but maintain two Linux distros (Ubuntu & Pengwin) using Windows Subsystem for Linux. I use Arch btw.

### MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015)

This is my laptop that I used to use for university. I first started learning web development on this machine. 

Although I do not use this computer as much as my custom built PC (mainly due to lesser processing power), I do love the portability this laptop provides. Moreover, I must say that I really do enjoy using Mac OSX, the UI is very polished and I like that it is UNIX-based.
