# Welcome

G'day, I'm [Alex](https://alexhe.io) 🙋‍♂️.

Welcome to [`rakuen (楽園)`](https://wiki.alexhe.io/), my digital garden, paradise, Eden or whatchamacallit. This personal wiki serves as a personal knowledge base where I share everything I know about this world in the form of an [online GitBook](https://wiki.alexhe.io/) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ioalex/garden). I also share a fair bit about myself throughout the wiki.

I coined this place `rakuen` because it sounds cool and the definition is rather fitting.

> 楽園: any place of complete bliss and delight and peace

Make yourself feel at home!

Feel free to [let me know you came along](https://ctt.ac/fomO8).

## Inspiration

- [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) - heavy inspiration, really like what he's done so I've shamelessly copied a lot of what Nikita done.
- [Brennan Letkeman](https://ltkmn.gitbook.io/brendex/) - another heavy inspiration
- [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) - my first introduction to the concept of a _digital garden_.
