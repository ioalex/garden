# Introduction

Hi, I'm [Alex](https://alex.notion.dog). 

Welcome to my Digital Garden!

This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in the form of an [online GitBook](https://wiki.alexhe.io/) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ioalex/garden).

Please close the door behind you! ðŸšª

## Inspiration

* [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) - heavy inspiration, really like what he's done so I've shamelessly copied a lot of what Nikita done.
* [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) - my first introduction to the concept of a _digital garden_.
