# Meta

Here you'll find all the notes that I am willing to share publicly. I continuously update them so this wiki will be like a reflection of my brain. I also use these notes myself for my own reference.

Each folder is a [topic that can include other topics](https://github.com/ioalex/garden/blob/main/SUMMARY.md) under it related to the parent topic.

Again, I will be updating this wiki quite often as I use it myself daily both to keep an account of things I know as well as things I want to know and everything in-between.

Note: Content is in Australian English. You may notice subtle differences in spelling if you're not from around these parts eg. color & colour.
