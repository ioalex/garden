# Principles

Principles will make your life much simpler. They will guide your actions in times of uncertainty and provide you with a road-map when life gets tough.

Here are some ideas and principles I try to follow:

- Follow the path of most resistance
- Don't stop doing the things that got you out of a bad situation.
- Record everything.
- Prioritise and execute
- Take relentless action
- Practice consistency over intensity
- Always remember 物极必反; which translates to [Things will develop in the opposite direction when they become extreme](https://baike.baidu.com/item/物极必反/5139) or as Jaden Smith says ["too much of good stuff is bad stuff."](https://youtu.be/n_H8UUxsuNA&start=7&end=24)
