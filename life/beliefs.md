# Beliefs

Some thoughts that I believe to be mostly true and align with:

- No one can compete with you on being you. Most of life is a search for who and what needs you the most.
- You do need to be deep in something because otherwise you’ll be a mile wide and an inch deep and you won’t get what you want out of life - find your _something_.
- A Native American proverb that I try to live by: "When you were born, you cried and the world rejoiced. Live your life in such a manner that when you die the world cries and you rejoice."
