# Beliefs

Some thoughts that I believe to be mostly true:

- No one can compete with you on being you. Most of life is a search for who and what needs you the most.
- You do need to be deep in something because otherwise you’ll be a mile wide and an inch deep and you won’t get what you want out of life - find your *something*.
