# Books

I read books in either their physical or digital eBook form, usually whatever is cheaper at the time. I also like to take advantage of audiobooks and like to listen to them when I am performing chores and other tasks that require low focus.

Here is a catalogue of all the books I have read so far... (since 2021):

## 2021

- The Almanack of Naval Ravikant \(Eric Jorgenson\)
- The Art of War \(Sun Tzu\)
- Can't Hurt Me \(David Goggins\)
- Digital Minimalism \(Cal Newport\)
- The Miracle Morning \(Hal Elrod\)
- Xero for Dummies \(4th Edition\) \(Heather Smith\)
- The Great Salesman in the World \(Og Mandino\)
- The Way to Wealth: Ben Franklin \(Benjamin Franklin\)
- The Simple Path to Wealth \(JL Collins\)
