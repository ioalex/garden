# Uses

I can be a bit of a pedant when it comes to the things I use. People who know me, know that I am usually quite frugal, however when it comes to my daily drivers, I don't mind spending the extra coin.

My purchasing principle is usually as follows: If I think and feel that an item can add value to my life and that \(often most importantly\) that value outweighs the price tag, then in my eyes it is worth the money. The value I typically look for is **convenience**; _does this item make my life easier?_ _How much time can I save by using this item?_

I thought it would be fun to list out everything that I use here. Furthermore, doing something like this allows me to take a step back and look at what I already have, so that I can:

1. Be grateful
2. Stop buying more shit
3. Look at what can be improved

I frequently change aspects of my setup / what constitutes as my daily drivers so I will try my best to keep this page updated.

## Hardware

### Custom Built PC \(2020\)

[PCPartPicker AU](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/mC6R7X)

This is my pride and joy - my first build, born during the midst of Victoria's COVID-19 lockdown. I had a tonne of fun building and learning how to build this machine.

I dual-boot Arch Linux and Windows 10. I use Arch daily for development and all other computer stuff. I primarily use Windows for gaming, but maintain two Linux distros \(Ubuntu & Pengwin\) using Windows Subsystem for Linux. I use Arch btw.

### MacBook Air \(13-inch, Early 2015\)

This is my laptop that I used to use for university. I first started learning web development on this machine.

Although I do not use this computer as much as my custom built PC \(mainly due to lesser processing power\), I do love the portability this laptop provides. Moreover, I must say that I really do enjoy using Mac OSX, the UI is very polished and I like that it is UNIX-based. There's also a lot of Mac-only apps that are really nice.

### iPhone 7 Plus

This is a hand-me-down from my mum. The phone is slowing down after years of use and the battery life is pretty unreliable. However, it does allow me to do things on-the-go. When I'm out and I need to do something, the iPhone usually has me covered - unless it dies on me, which is why I always make sure to take my RAVPower powerbank when I'm heading out.

I like to use cross-platform apps. I have many iOS Shortcuts and automations set-up.

I would like an upgrade, but with the cost of the latest iPhones, an upgrade won't be happening anytime soon \(I am knee deep into the Apple ecosystem\).

### iPad Air 2

Also a hand-me-down from my mum \(thanks mum\). I use the iPad to read Medium articles and my Kindle purchases, as well as check on my to-do list. I don't really take it out the house, mainly use this in the toilet. I use this device the least.

### Others

- **Monitors**: Acer ED320QR S & Acer ED320QRP
  - The two monitors are basically the same \(both 31.5" Curved & FHD w/ 165Hz\).
  - Dual monitors are awesome, definitely a productivity booster for me.
  - Held up with my trusty Brateck LDT47-C024N monitor mount.
- **Keyboard**: Logitech Craft
  - Pretty much got this for the knob.
- **Mouse**: Logitech MX Master 3
  - My favourite mouse of all-time - not that I've tried very many.
  - Favourite feature: The Hyper-fast Scrollwheel
  - Second favourite feature: The Easy-Switch button - allows me to switch between my linked devices.
- **Speakers**: Audioengine A2+
  - A new addition to my setup - a gift from my girlfriend.
  - The look and sound quality on these speakers are fucking great.
- **Headphones**: Bose Quietcomfort 35 II
  - I've had these for years - very reliable and great battery life, perfect for travel.
- **Webcam**: Logitech C922 Pro Stream
  - I hate it when my face is mirrored.
- **Microphone**: Audio Technica AT2020
  - I feel like a Twitch streamer when I'm using this.
- **Audio Interface**: Steinberg UR12
  - Works great with my microphone. Haven't had any issues using this across the different [operating systems](https://github.com/ioalex/garden/tree/ba62a91ff12301378a22e57344f1641f08b5dd94/uses/tech/computers/operating-systems/README.md) I use.
- **Docking Station**: Targus USB-C Universal Dual Video 4K \(freebie from work\)
  - The latest addition to my setup. This is a really cool device that allows me to connect my MacBook and work laptop to my dual monitors, as well as charge them through one USB-C/A cable.
  - I have a KVM switch hooked to this, so that I can use the same peripherals across my PC and whatever device is linked, with the click of a button.
- **Watch**: Fitbit Versa 2
  - I use my Fitbit to track and monitor my steps, heart rate and sleep quality. The battery life is starting to slow down but other than that I can't complain - it's good at what it does!

## Software

### Operating Systems

#### Arch Linux

My day-to-day workhorse. The installation process was really fun and definitely different to what I had previously experienced. I love that the installation is minimal and bare-bones as it allows me to customise how I do things to my heart's content. The [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) is bloody amazing \(probably what sold me on Arch\) and the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) community is very active.

#### Windows 10

Pretty standard stuff. I use Windows 10 mostly for gaming \([VALORANT](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/)\) but do have Ubuntu and Pengwin set-up via WSL2. I must say, the developer experience you get from Pengwin is top notch.

#### macOS

Everyone's beloved Apple OS. Was a good experience when I all I had was my MacBook. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) has a strong community around it so using the command line gave me no problems.

### What's On My iPhone?

#### iOS Automations

I generally try to automate anything that I can afford to. The reason being that I want to **simplify** life for myself. In a day, we are limited in the amount of time, energy and focus that we have. By automating different aspects of my life, I set up systems so that I save time and mental energy for more important task, even if its only a few minutes.
