# What's On My Mind?

_Last updated on 01/11/2021._

## üí≠ Quote I'm pondering -

> "Julius Caesar famously said, **"If you want it done, then go. And if not, then send."** What he meant was, if you want it done right, then you have to go yourself and do it. When you are the principal, then you are the owner‚Äîyou care, and you will do a great job. When you are the agent and you are doing it on somebody else's behalf, you can do a bad job. You just don't care. You optimize for yourself rather than for the principal's assets." \- [Naval Ravikant](https://nav.al/)

## üìö What I'm [reading](books.md) -

[I Will Teach You to Be Rich](https://www.amazon.com.au/Will-Teach-You-Be-Rich-dp-1523505745/dp/1523505745/) - A popular personal finance book written by [Ramit Sethi](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/). I've only read up to the second chapter of the book. So far, there hasn't been any new ideas that I've come across.

[How To Be Successful](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) - A blogpost written by [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/) that I come back to over and over. The advice and wisdom in this piece are invaluable and are applicable to many.

## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Person I'm studying -

[Naval Ravikant](https://nav.al/) - I first came across Naval's work through snippets of his podcast on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh_dVD10YuSghle8g6yjePg). Diving in the rabbit hole, I discovered his book; the [Almanack of Naval Ravikant](https://www.navalmanack.com/). I have read the Almanack more than thrice and will likely go over it again in the near future. Within, he shares his philosophy and ideas on how to be both successful and happy - which are two things I want in life.

## üì∞ Newsletter I‚Äôm subscribing to -

[Daily Market Briefs](https://dailymarketbriefs.com/) - A byte-sized US stock market newsletter that I found browsing [Vincent Chan's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Vincentc). Provides some daily insights for me to explore investment ideas.
