# Budgeting

My current automation system looks like this:

- 50% Savings
- 10%
- 30% Fixed costs (rent, groceries etc.)
- 2% Travel fund
- 1% Gift fund
- 17% Spend on whatever I want guilt-free

I use YNAB methodology to somewhat manage my spending but not proactively. I try to be mindful with my spending at all times and try to never disregard spending on quality healthy food and essentials for my well being. Both N26 & Monzo track spending into categories and do a good job of it.

## Ongoing subscriptions

I use the [Bobby iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bobby-track-subscriptions/id1059152023) to track my ongoing subscriptions. I review it every week or so to view any upcoming payments.
