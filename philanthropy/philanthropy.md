# Philanthropy

## Etymology, Definition & Views

The word **'philanthropy'** is of Greek origin and is made up of the words **"philos"** (meaning "loving, fond of, tending to") and **"anthropos,"** (meaning "pertaining to man or human beings"). When put together, philanthropy loosely means love of humankind.<sup>[1]</sup>

The essential meaning of **'philanthropy'** as depicted by [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/philanthropy) is:

> the practice of giving money and time to help make life better for other people.

The aforementioned definition for **'philanthropy'** is what I believe most people would liken the word to. However, I think people focus more on the money aspect and forget that they can volunteer their time. Though admittedly, I myself at times have faced much less resistance by deciding to donate money instead of my time.

## Tax benefits in Australia

You can claim a tax deduction for gifts or donations to charities in Australia. However, this only the case when the following conditions are met:

- The organisation must be a [deductible gift recipient (DGR)](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Income-and-deductions/Deductions-you-can-claim/Other-deductions/Gifts-and-donations/#WhatisaDGR)
- Gifts or donations must be voluntary and you do not receive or have no expectation to receive any material benefit or advantage in return
- Must be of money or property, including financial assets
- Must comply with any relevant gift conditions

To claim a deduction, you must have a record of your donation such as a receipt.

If you made donations of $2 or more to bucket collections, you can claim a tax deduction for gifts up to $10 without a receipt. To claim contributions of more than $10, you will eed a receipt.

I like the idea of giving more of my hard-earned money to causes I care about.
