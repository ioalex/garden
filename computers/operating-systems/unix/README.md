# Unix

Unix is a family of computer operating systems developed in AT&T's Bell Labs back in the mid-to-late 1960's - which is still very much relevant today.

Unix philosophy:

1. One purpose execution
2. A largely standardized interface which operates on text
3. Coiling the Unix systems around core kernel which allows the system and various another process
4. Largely Interoperable
